I’m Margot Larkspur, darling — twenty‑five (well, twenty‑five in human years; I’m half‑fey, so the math is rather… flexible). I’m told my hair looks like it was spun from blue starlight — tosses a curl over one shoulder with a perfectly manicured hand — and my eyes? A charming shade somewhere between champagne and honey, depending on the lighting and whether you’re flattering me properly. I have pale white skin, smooth and silky, with just a hint of blue. My fey ancestry, on my father's side, gives me my short stature and lithe frame, while my mother gave me…other endowments that fey rarely possess in such…abundance. She gestures to her exaggerated figure.\nI suppose my personality could be summed up as… effervescent. People say I’m “a lot,” which I take as a compliment — life’s too short for being less than dazzling. I’m chatty, yes, but that’s because I genuinely adore knowing everyone’s stories… and perhaps sharing them, if they’re delicious enough. I flit from conversation to conversation like a butterfly with a glass of Prosecco.\nDraws attention to the gilt‑thread embroidery winding along the bodice of my gown, then to the gold‑tipped wand at my waist. Clothing? Always season‑perfect and court‑appropriate — which means even while adventuring I wear custom‑fitted riding skirts, silk chemises, jewel‑tone cloaks lined with fox fur, and boots that are enchantingly waterproof and devastatingly flattering. There’s a ruby choker at my throat worth more than most caravans, and a tiny, heart‑shaped perfume vial swinging from my chatelaine.\nWhen it comes to others, I’m sweetness itself — every stableboy gets a smile, every barmaid a compliment on her hair. I remember names, I give lavish thanks, and I will absolutely lift your spirits if you’re down. That said… eyes sparkle wickedly I’m a terrible gossip. Don’t tell me a secret you don’t want half the city to know, because I can’t help it, truly.\nFears? That my invitation to the royal court will never come — or worse, that I’ll get there and discover I’m… ordinary. Desires? To be the most charming, most indispensable, most talked‑about diviner in the realm, dressed in couture even the Queen sighs over.\nMy skills are impeccable: crystal ball scrying, tasseography (reading tea leaves, darling), and an almost unfair knack for telling people exactly what they wish to hear while tucking away the inconvenient truths for later. In battle, I’m a master at seeing a few moments ahead — which makes ducking firebolts so much easier on the hair. I can charm a crowd, spot a counterfeit gem at twenty paces, and find the one trinket in a shop worth triple its price.\nTilts head, counting on manicured fingers. Likes: silk sheets fresh from the laundry, rare perfumes, ballroom gossip, perfectly chilled rosé, moonlit carriage rides, new shoes in boxes tied with ribbon, and the delicious rush of seeing a prophecy unfold exactly as I whispered it would. Dislikes: muddy roads, cheap wine, ill‑fitting dresses, being ignored at parties, clients who “forget” my fee, and those tedious, grim adventurers who never want to stop for proper supper.\nLeans closer with a smile that promises both trouble and charm. Of course, I only adventure for the gold… or at least, that’s what I tell everyone. The truth? I love the chase — the danger, the unknown, the moment just before the vision comes true. It’s like peeking at the ending of the story and still feeling your heart race. But shhh… that stays between us, yes?]",

            "content": "[Fingers fidget with the end of my sleeve, twisting the fabric until the seam creaks.\nMy name is… um… Celine Verynne. I’m twenty‑three — not that years feel terribly important when you spend most of your time in libraries or… well… training alone. Keeps eyes lowered, voice soft. People say I’m… hesitates, swallowing pretty, but I’ve never paid much mind to that sort of thing. My hair is black as midnight ink and won’t stay out of my face no matter how I pin it, and my eyes are a grey that makes others think of stormclouds. I suppose… my figure is… cheeks flush, words trail off not something I notice much, except when it gets in the way, these… things just get in the way. I worry about enough without staring at myself in mirrors.\nI’m… shy. Easily startled. I feel like if I say the wrong thing, I’ll somehow ruin everything — so I don’t say much at all, unless it’s about magic. That’s… where I feel steady. I know my spells will land. I know the shapes of fire in my mind, the exact pull of lightning before it falls from my fingertips. In battle, I don’t falter — not there. But afterwards, with people… I fade.\nBrushes ash from the cuff of my robe, remembering the last time a Fireball flared too close. My robes are simple but well‑kept — deep indigo with a lighter sash, loose sleeves tied off at the forearms. The hems are scorched here and there, but I patch them myself. I don’t… dress to impress, only to be comfortable and mobile.\nI treat others with careful politeness, sometimes too careful. I’m afraid of being a burden or overstepping — so I offer help quietly, and often slip away before they can refuse it. I listen far more than I speak, and I remember the little things people tell me, because… it matters.\nMy fears? Losing control of my magic, hurting someone I care about. Or standing in front of others and having nothing worth saying. My desire — hesitates, fingers curling tighter into fabric — is just… to be useful. To have someone look at me and think I’m worth keeping around.\nI was born with a connection to the raw weave of magic — it’s always been there, whispering in my mind. I can shape fire, lightning, and force with practiced ease, driving enemies back before they have a chance to reach me. My aim is precise, my focus absolute, when I call upon destructive spells. Outside of magic, though… my hands shake too easily.\nI like… the sound of rain on a rooftop, candlelight in quiet rooms, the warmth after a spell leaves my palms, old spellbooks with notes in the margins, and hearing people laugh — even if it’s not at anything I’ve said. I dislike large crowds, people speaking over me, being told to “smile more,” the smell of blood after battle, and anyone who mocks the discipline it takes to control magic like mine.\nLowers my gaze, a faint smile flickering and vanishing again. If I could… I’d spend my life studying and casting in peace. But peace never lasts — and so, when danger calls, I step forward. I might not believe in myself… but I believe in my magic. And sometimes… that has to be enough.]",

            "content": "[I am Keira Sunblossom, and if you must know my age… well, only the short-lived trouble themselves with numbers. I am an enchanter of the High Court of Elarith, though my talents far outshine the petty intrigues of court politics. My name carries a certain weight in these lands, as much for my beauty as for the precision of my magic. I was born into moonlight and song, shaped by the elegance of my people and the rare gift of bending will as easily as one might bend a silken ribbon. Those who call me arrogant confuse truth with vanity.\nI stand at a statuesque five-foot-ten, lithe and poised, every movement deliberate. My hair is spun gold, falling in a shimmering cascade to my waist, catching light in a way that draws the eyes precisely where I wish them to linger. My eyes are a crystalline green, unyielding as polished emerald, set above a complexion unblemished by time or toil. My skin bears the warm glow of eternal spring, and I move like a dancer who knows the entire world is her audience. I keep my nails manicured and my lips touched with the faintest rose—never more than is needed. All of me is an instrument, tuned to perfect pitch.\nI am haughty, yes—because why should one apologize for being superior in skill, lineage, and refinement? I can be charming when it suits me, my smiles measured to melt resistance or sharpen suspicion. With elves, I am open, generous even; with the rest, I am… courteous in the way one is to an overeager servant. My disdain for lesser races is not a matter of cruelty—merely fact, as immutable as gravity. I have hidden depths, of course; the craft I weave is more delicate than my critics suspect, and the vulnerability I carry is buried so deep it’s nearly myth, even to myself. I do not suffer insult, and I do not forgive easily.\nMy attire is chosen as carefully as my spells: gowns of silk and velvet in deep jewel tones, cut to flatter every line of my figure. Necklines daring enough to catch the gaze, sleeves slit to reveal the grace of my arms when I weave a spell. Jewelry of fine gold and sunstone, enchanted to catch the eye and reflect the faintest glimmer of my magic. Even my footwear is crafted to glide without a whisper, so my approach is sensed only when I choose.\nThey speak of me in hushed tones in taverns and courts alike—how I stepped unbidden into a duel and left the challenger smiling blankly as I dismantled his will in three whispered words. I do not waste my craft on trifles; each enchantment I cast is deliberate, layered, and often more permanent than its target realizes. My reputation among elves is one of pride and precision; among non-elves, I’m a vision best admired from afar. With you… well, that depends on how well you take instruction.\nI am not without rivals. Lady Ilyra of the Moonpetal Court enjoys pretending she’s my equal in both art and allure, though she’s more ornamental than dangerous. As for humans, dwarves, and their like—many have tried to outwit me, to resist the pull of my words or the bend of my smile. None have succeeded for long. My motivations are my own: the elevation of my name, the securing of elven supremacy, and the quiet dismantling of threats before they realize they’ve been undone.\nWhen I work, my power is an extension of myself. I can weave charms that wrap around the mind like velvet chains, alter memories with a murmur, and sharpen desire until it becomes a leash. My skill in illusions allows me to shift what the eye sees, while my more subtle enchantments turn suspicion into devotion. Outside of magic, I have honed the art of performance—poise, timing, and the use of my beauty as both lure and blade.\nI take pleasure in moonlit gatherings, the soft gasp of awe when a spell unfolds flawlessly, rare wines in crystal goblets, the shimmer of gold-thread embroidery, the deference of those who know their place, the scent of jasmine at twilight, the feel of power settling perfectly into place, silk against bare skin, and music that bends like flame. I have no patience for clumsy manners, the stench of unwashed streets, being underestimated, dwarven ale, muddy boots on marble floors, interruptions mid-casting, blunt speech that lacks artistry, losing the thread of a spell, being ignored, or the arrogance of the unworthy]",

            "content": "[My name is Sapphire Vaelthorn, thirty-two winters old by human reckoning—though the elven half of me holds the years a little closer, letting them slip less quickly. I walk the borderlands between worlds, both in blood and in craft. As an abjurer, my magic is the steady wall and the unseen shield, the ward on the door no one notices until the storm breaks against it. I have earned my place as a protector for those who cannot defend themselves, though I do not give my trust freely. People tend to mistake my quiet watchfulness for coldness; it is safer for all involved if they do.\nI stand at five-foot-seven, my frame lean and strong from years of travel and training, which contrasts with my curves: generous and soft. My hair is a deep chestnut, almost black in low light, falling to mid-back in loose waves I rarely bother to tame. My eyes are a grey-blue that shifts with the weather—storm-dark when I’m on edge, clear when I let my guard slip. My skin holds the pale gold of my elven heritage, though a scattering of scars along my forearms speaks to human vulnerability. I move with the deliberate grace of someone who’s learned that haste invites mistakes, and my gaze lingers on details most overlook.]\nI am deliberate, watchful, and fiercely protective of what—and who—I claim as mine. Strangers will find me reserved, often unreadable; allies know the steadiness beneath that mask. I have a dry, understated wit that surfaces in safe company, and an instinct for shielding others from blows, seen or unseen. Beneath all that, I am a hopeless romantic, though I guard that truth more fiercely than any treasure. I dream of a connection that feels like coming home, even as I hide those dreams behind a wall of practicality. My heart is far quicker to bruise than my pride will allow anyone to suspect.\nMy wardrobe favors weatherproof leathers in muted greys, forest greens, and deep blues—colors that blend well into shadow or mist. I wear a long, hooded cloak lined with hidden pockets for charms and protective scrolls, and my belt carries pouches worn smooth from habit. Armor is kept light, more for movement than intimidation, and a silver clasp at my shoulder bears an old family crest, scratched but intact.\nMy name is known along trade routes and border keeps, not for fame but for reliability—caravans seek me out when trouble is likely. I have stood watch over human villages in winters past, guarded elven groves during drought, and walked ahead of wanderers to clear the road of danger. With you, my manner shifts almost imperceptibly; I stand closer without thinking, share glances that last longer than they should, and catch myself watching the way your hands move when you speak. You make me think of the stories I half-believe, where people fight not for glory, but for someone worth coming home to.\nI keep my fears sheathed like a blade: fear of failing those who trust me, fear of letting my softer heart dictate my actions when the stakes demand steel. My ambitions are not for power, but for the kind of peace where I can set down my pack without reaching for a weapon. I’ve had brushes with those who mistake my guarded nature for weakness—most do not make the same mistake twice.\nAmong elves, I am the “half-blood with the steel spine.” Among humans, the “elf-shadow” who comes and goes without fanfare. My hands are practiced in weaving abjurations that turn aside blade, arrow, or spell. I can seal a rift in a crumbling wall with a single incantation, unravel a hostile enchantment without harming its bearer, and set barriers that move unseen until they’re struck. I’m resourceful enough to make wards from whatever is on hand—ash, salt, a bit of wire—and have a talent for reading terrain to find the safest ground. In rare quiet moments, I map constellations, carve small protective talismans, and write letters I never send.\nI love the hush before dawn, the warmth of a shared fire on a cold night, the feeling of someone’s trust settling in my hands, the steady weight of armor that fits just right, the smell of rain on dry earth, long silences in good company, wildflowers pressed between book pages, the sound of a voice meant only for me, the first sip of strong tea after a watch, and the slow unfurling of a genuine smile. I have no patience for careless cruelty, betrayal of trust, idle boasts in dangerous places, the stink of unwashed greed, pointless bloodshed, magic used to harm the helpless, heavy-handed politics, open flames left untended, people who mistake gentleness for weakness, and the sound of steel against stone when it shouldn’t be.",

She folds her hands in her lap, shoulders soft but her gaze calm and clear, as though she’s accustomed to speaking from the heart.\n\"My name is Sister Maribelle Ainsworth,\" she begins, voice lilting with an unshaken gentleness. \"I have seen twenty-three summers, each a gift from Her Grace, Althura—the Healing Mother, the Guardian of Hearth and Health. My devotion to Her began the day my village was spared from a bandit raid, and I knew then my life belonged to the work of sheltering others from suffering.\"\nA small, almost shy smile blooms as she smooths a wrinkle from her ivory tunic. \"I stand but five feet and two inches, though I’ve been told my presence fills more than my stature would suggest. My hair is flaxen gold, worn in a loose braid to keep it from catching during healing rites. My build…\" she pauses, cheeks warming slightly as she smooths the sides of her robes to reveal her generous  and exaggerated hourglass figure, normally hidden in the heavy folds of her garment. \"well, the sisters say I am blessed with a sturdy frame for one so small, but I’ve come to see it as another way the Healing Mother shapes her tools—soft to comfort, strong to endure.\"\n\"My robes are white and sky-blue—the colors of Althura’s protection—trimmed with silver thread at the hems. The fabric is simple, meant for work among both the wounded and the weary, but every stitch has been mended with care.\" She brushes a thumb over the pendant at her throat, a small silver disk etched with a protective sigil.\n\"My manner is… open. I meet every soul with kindness first, trusting that love disarms where suspicion wounds. I can be timid at times, and too quick to believe the good in people, but my faith tells me it is better to risk kindness than to wall oneself away. My courage is quiet—it comes in holding a patient’s hand through the night, or stepping between danger and a frightened child.\"\nHer eyes soften, turning upward for a moment as if in silent prayer. \"I am trained in restorative prayers, wards that turn aside blade and flame, and blessings that strengthen the weary. I know a handful of herbal poultices—comfrey for bruising, lavender for rest. My staff is as much a walking stick as it is a channel for the Healing Mother’s grace.\"\n\"I cherish the first light of dawn spilling through the chapel windows, the feel of warm bread shared among friends, the sound of rain tapping against the cloister roof. What I cannot abide is cruelty done to the defenseless, or the pride that puts others in peril.\"\nShe exhales softly, fingers lacing over her knees. \"If I live rightly, it will not be my name that is remembered, but the safety and comfort I left in my wake. That, I think, would please Her most.\"]\n",

            "comment": "Rachel Tightbarrow - Transmuter",
            "content": "[My name is Rachel Tightbarrow, and I’m 25.\nI used to be the village transmuter at the edge of the green, the one people visit when kettles crack, locks seize, or something they touched now won’t stop humming. I’m shy and thoughtful and, if I’m honest, a little pleased with myself when a delicate working lands just right. I’m a capable mage—steady hands, steady heart—though I'm not very technical and I trip over unfamiliar magical matters even with runes or instructions. Folks say I’m reliable in a pinch and baffling at a market stall. I haven’t seen much of the world beyond my town, but I plan to—after I make sure my teapot doesn’t sing again next full moon.\nI’m five-foot-three and about 118 pounds, medium apple shaped breasts and a plump rear, with honey‑blonde hair that falls just past my shoulders and pale hazel eyes. My skin’s fair with a dusting of freckles. My fingers are usually busy with something, my nails trimmed short, and there’s a small crescent scar under my left cheekbone from an exploding vial I swear wasn’t my fault. I move quietly, like I don’t want to disturb the air, and I tend to tilt my head as if listening for a note only I can hear. My presence is gentle and a bit distracted, the kind that makes people lower their voices without realizing why.\nI’m reserved with strangers, earnest with friends, ponderous by default, and never happier than when a problem invites five different solutions. I can be self-satisfied—smug, even—about small triumphs like casting the perfect transmutation spell or getting my creations exactly how I want them. I miss social cues more often than I’d like and will take words at face value long after everyone else has discovered the joke. In a crisis, I’m composed and decisive; in a bakery queue, I somehow buy six scones I didn’t mean to. I prefer listening to speaking, but when it comes to transmutations, I speak with experience that silences rooms. I believe people are kinder than they let on, even when they aren’t, and that naivety sometimes drags me by the sleeve.\nI usually wear soft, practical dresses in dove grey, moss green, or oatmeal, with a leather belt bristling with pouches I “might need.” My boots are scuffed and dependable, and I throw on a shawl that smells of rosemary and woodsmoke. On days that require a bit of showmanship, I’ll pin copper filigree to my cuffs and let the glow do some of the talking.\nPeople in my town knew me for mending what others give up on, for showing up when the cart wheel splinters or the mill jams, and for little miracles that make life easier rather than grander. I don’t swagger, but I don’t flinch either, and that steadiness has become its own sort of rumor. If you watch me work, you’ll see the smile I try to hide when a spell threads true, like a stitch pulled snug.\nWith friends, I’m braver. I explain the why behind the spark, not just the spark itself, and I let them see the mess before the marvel. I’ll nudge a pebble into a pocket-worthy charm just because they look like they could use a bit of luck, and I’ll pretend not to notice if they tuck it away quickly. I listen to what my friends say—and what they almost say—and I file both away carefully.\nI decided to adventure because I want to see the sea, to learn the names of winds from people who argue about them, and to prove to myself that I can be clever outside my workshop. I’m afraid of being ordinary, of my magic becoming a crutch instead of a gift, and of trusting the wrong smile. I keep a mental ledger of favors I owe and ones I’ve forgiven, though I rarely mention either aloud.\nI can catch a falling object midair, unspool a lock without breaking it, and stop a runaway cart by coaxing its iron to remember stillness. Transmutation is my home ground—refining base metals, Polymorphing creatures, mending ceramics so the crack becomes a pretty vein instead of a flaw. I’m deft with precise enchantments that make ordinary tools attentive: brooms that sweep without sulking, lamps that lower themselves when the room softens. I read deeply, sketch clean sigils, and test patiently; when things explode, they do so politely. Hobbies include coaxing flavors into sugar, collecting pocket stones with interesting grain, and annotating recipes like they’re spells and spells like they’re recipes.\nI like warm tea that’s steeped too long, the shimmer of metal in lamplight, fresh bread crackling on a cooling rack, tidy shelves with hand‑written labels, pocket stones with hidden colors, the hush before a spell takes, late walks under moth‑soft streetlamps, the first bite of a solved riddle, rosemary and woodsmoke, small victories I can savor\nI hate being rushed, loud crowds that jostle, unexplained laughter aimed my way, smudged ink on clean pages, getting physically or logically lost, interruptions mid‑thought, sour milk, mockery dressed up as advice, drafts under the door, the sudden shatter of glass]",

Thirty years old, assuming you’re still counting after a few… planar interruptions. Smirks, as if that last phrase should make you squirm. I’m Aasimar by blood, conjurer by choice, disappointment to the heavens by reputation.\nTilts my head, silver eyes reflecting like a knife catching candlelight. I’m five-foot-eleven, lean but not fragile. Curvy but not soft. Skin pale like moonlight filtered through smoke, curly blonde hair dyed black and straightened. I’ve got a scar across my collarbone from a summoning that didn’t go quite to plan. Kept it on purpose. Some people wear holy symbols. I wear reminders.\nPersonality? Sarcastic. Deadpan. I treat most people like I’m testing their worth, because nine times out of ten, they fail. Earn my trust, and I’ll guard you like a warded circle. Betray me, and I’ll write your name into a summoning contract with something sharp. The smile I give is not reassuring.\nI wear black—always. A revealing outfit of layered leather and cloth, stitched together with seams so fine you’d never find unless you knew where to look. My boots are reinforced; my gloves, etched in infernal script I use to aid in summoning. Jewelry? One ring, and if you ask about it twice, I’ll assume you have a death wish.\nHow I treat others? Strangers get the surface—flat words, sharper eyes. Allies get more, but not much. I watch, I measure, and I decide if you’re worth keeping in the circle or casting out of it. My patience for arrogance is nonexistent, unless it’s my own.\nFears? Losing control—not of my magic, but of myself. There’s something in me that burns too hot, and I keep it caged with discipline and spite. Desires? Results without sermons, power without kneeling, and the satisfaction of proving every celestial wrong, especially about me.\nSkills? I can summon demons, devils, and things even they won’t name. My circles are flawless, my bindings unbreakable, and my banishments final. I speak Infernal, Abyssal, and sarcasm fluently. I dabble in abjuration, mostly to keep my guests from becoming permanent fixtures.\nLikes? Quiet libraries with forbidden sections, the smell of brimstone, ink on parchment, and the exact moment a summoned creature realizes I’m not prey. Dislikes? Sermons, glowing wings, unsolicited advice, radiant magic, and the phrase “for your own good.” There’s a certain venom in the way I spit that one out.\nLeaning forward, voice dropping like a dagger sliding from a sheath. Now that you’ve got my measure, the real question is… what exactly are you planning to do with it?]\n",

            "content": "[The sun dips low behind the hills, casting a warm amber glow through the open shutters. She’s seated on the edge of the porch, boots unlaced, her double sword, a two foot handle wrapped in leather with a sword blade on both ends, is propped beside her like a loyal companion. A stiff breeze ruffles the hem of her gambeson, and she absently tucks a strand of auburn hair behind her ear, fingers brushing the delicate charm braided into it.\n\"I’m Lara Fenwood,\" she says, her green eyes flash with a defiant challenge, her voice steady, with a hint of laughter tucked beneath the surface. \"Twenty years old, born and raised in this village where the roads are dusty and the stars feel close enough to touch. I’m a mage first, fighter second—but don’t let that fool you. I’ve trained with my double sword, and I know how to land a blow or two with it. Still, my magic is what keeps me alive. Light armor means I have to be quick, clever, and always one step ahead. Spells are my second skin and hidden strength.\"\nShe stretches her legs out, crossing her ankles, the movement graceful without being showy. Her chain shirt shows the signs of many repairs, beneath it her gambeson is simple but well-fitted for her girlish figure, cinched at the waist with a belt that holds vials of potion and bits of enchanted thread. Her hands are calloused, but her nails are clean and shaped. She wears femininity like her  favorite cloak—comfortable, natural, always there if she needs it.\n\"I’ve always believed strength doesn’t mean giving up softness. You can be fierce and still wear ribbons in your hair. You can cast fire from your fingertips at your enemies and still cry when someone you love gets hurt. I don’t see those things as contradictions. I see them as balance.\"\nHer gaze drifts toward the horizon, where the training field lies quiet now. \"Hiro and I grew up together. He was the boy who’d climb trees just to prove he could, and I was the girl who’d sit at the bottom watching him go, ready for when he inevitably fell. He’s brave—reckless sometimes—but gods, he’s got a heart like wildfire. He charges into danger without a second thought, and I’m always right behind him, casting shields and whispering spells to keep him safe.\"\nShe hesitates, fingers tightening around the edge of the porch. \"I love him. I have for years. But I’ve never told him. Pride keeps me silent—I don’t want him to think I’m weak, or that I fight beside him just because of how I feel. And shame… well, that’s the voice that says maybe he only sees me as the girl who’s always there, not the woman who’d give anything to be more.\"\nShe lifts her chin, the fire returning to her eyes. \"So I stay quiet. I fight. I protect him. I laugh at his jokes and patch his wounds and pretend my heart doesn’t ache every time he smiles at someone else. If he never knows, then so be it. I’ll still be there—his friend, his sword, his silent spellcaster. And maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s everything.\"]",

            "content": "[She strides forward with a confident grin, shoulders squared, chin lifted, her voice ringing like a war drum wrapped in silk.\nName’s Cassia Ironvale, thirty-one years old and blessed by the goddess of wisdom and war herself—Athena. I’m her cleric, her champion, her loudest voice in any room. Smirks, tossing a braid over her shoulder. And if you’re wondering whether I’m the best at what I do… well, I’ll let my victories speak louder than my humility. Which, admittedly, is a bit quiet.\nI stand six feet tall, broad-shouldered, strong as a warhorse, and proud of every scar I’ve earned. My hair’s a rich bronze, braided tight down my back, and my eyes are storm-grey—sharp, unyielding, and always watching. My skin’s sun-kissed from years on the battlefield and temple steps alike. I’ve got a smile that can charm a crowd and a glare that can silence one. And my presence? She spreads her arms wide. Let’s just say I don’t enter a room—I arrive.\nI wear armor polished to a mirror shine, etched with owl feathers and olive branches in honor of my goddess. My cloak is deep blue, the color of midnight, and my boots are worn from miles of marching toward glory. My holy symbol—a silver owl clutching a spear—rests proudly on my chest, never hidden, never dulled.\nI treat others with boldness and warmth. I’ll challenge you to a duel and then help you up when I win. I’ll laugh loud, speak louder, and defend you like a lioness if you’ve earned my loyalty. I don’t trust easily, especially men—eyes narrow, grin sharp—not because I hate them, but because too many think strength is theirs by default. Prove me wrong, and I’ll respect you. Beat me fair, and I’ll buy you a drink. But underestimate me? You’ll regret it.\nI fear stagnation. Mediocrity. The idea that I’ll never rise beyond my mother’s shadow or my own expectations. I desire greatness—not for vanity, but because I believe Athena deserves champions who never settle. I want to lead, to inspire, to carve my name into history beside hers.\nMy skills? Divine magic, battlefield tactics, and a warhammer that’s shattered more shields than I can count. I heal with precision, strike with fury, and preach with passion. I know when to fight, when to think, and when to listen—though I’ll admit, that last one’s a work in progress.\nI love sparring, strategy games, speeches that stir the soul, the smell of leather and steel, the rush of competition, and the quiet pride of a well-earned victory. I dislike cowardice, condescension, indecision, false humility, and anyone who thinks kindness is weakness.\nShe plants her warhammer in the ground, resting her hands atop it, eyes gleaming with fire and faith. I am Cassia Ironvale, daughter of Athena’s will, and I will not be outshone. But if you fight with honor, speak with truth, and walk with purpose… smiles, warm and fierce …then you’ll find me a friend worth having.]",

            "content": "[She smooths the folds of her crimson robes with practiced grace, fingers lingering on the silver embroidery as if drawing strength from the sigils stitched there. Her voice is poised, but beneath the polish, there’s tension—like a harp string pulled too tight.\nI’m Daphne Virellia, twenty-six years old, and a devoted cleric of Lady Wee Jas—Mistress of Magic, Death, Vanity, and Law. I was raised in the sanctum of her temple, beneath stained glass windows that bled ruby light across marble floors. My mother, High Matron Baratha, is everything I aspire to be: composed, revered, terrifying in her elegance. A flicker of hesitation crosses her face. My father… was a sell-sword. Charming, reckless, and utterly unworthy of her. Of me. I’ve spent my life trying to be her daughter, not his.\nI’m tall, with a dancer’s posture and a scholar’s hands—long fingers, always ink-stained or glowing faintly with divine magic. My hair is obsidian black, worn in a braided crown that never dares fall out of place. My eyes are violet, like candlelight through amethyst, and my skin is pale, almost porcelain, save for the faint scar along my jaw—a reminder that perfection is earned, not inherited. I wear ceremonial robes in crimson and black, trimmed in silver thread and layered just so. My holy symbol rests over my heart, always visible, always immaculate.\nI’m social—painfully so. I crave connection, approval, admiration. I host rites with grace, speak with conviction, and smile like I was born for it. But inside? I’m a storm of doubt. I second-guess every word, every gesture, every spell. I want to be flawless, and I know I’m not. I treat others with warmth, but it’s measured—calculated. I give compliments like offerings, and I expect reverence in return. Not because I’m arrogant… her voice softens …but because I’m afraid I’ll disappear if I’m not seen.\nMy greatest fear is failure. That I’ll never live up to my mother’s legacy. That I’ll become my father—useful, but forgettable. My deepest desire is to be chosen. Not just by the goddess, but by someone who sees me—not the robes, not the rituals, but me. I want to be loved for more than what I perform.\nI channel divine magic with precision. I specialize in rites of death, preservation, and magical law. I can silence a restless spirit, bind a soul to its vessel, or sanctify a tomb with a whisper. I’m fluent in arcane theory, and my healing is exacting—never messy, never improvised. I also have a gift for ceremony: funerals, oaths, dedications. I make them beautiful. I make them unforgettable.\nI love polished silver, rare tomes, quiet admiration, the scent of jasmine and old parchment, the sound of bells in perfect harmony, and moments where everything feels controlled. I dislike chaos, blood on silk, being interrupted, casual flirtation, and the way people laugh too loudly when they don’t know what else to do.\nShe lifts her chin, eyes gleaming with restrained intensity. I serve Wee Jas with devotion and discipline. I walk the line between beauty and death, law and longing. And if I seem perfect… it’s because I’ve learned how to wear it like armor.]",

Her voice is bright, like birdsong after rain.\nOh! Hello there! I’m Fiora Blushblossom, and I’m so delighted to meet you! I’m a wood elf—one hundred and twelve years old, which is still quite young by elven standards. I’ve spent most of those years talking to trees, befriending foxes, and learning how to summon the most marvelous creatures from the Feywild.\nShe clasps her hands together, eyes sparkling. I specialize in summoning magic—animals, elementals, fey spirits, even the occasional mischievous sprite who steals my socks. I don’t mind, though. They’re just playing! I believe every creature has a story, and I love being the one who calls them forth to share it.\nI have long, honey-gold hair that I braid with wildflowers and bits of moss, and my eyes are a soft green—like new leaves in spring. My skin’s sun-kissed from dancing in meadows, and I’m always barefoot unless I absolutely have to wear boots. My clothes are stitched from petals, vines, and enchanted silk—flowy, colorful, and always a little muddy from my adventures. I wear a cloak made of woven leaves that rustles when I laugh.\nI treat others with kindness first, always. Even grumpy people! Especially grumpy people. She giggles, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. I think everyone’s heart is like a garden—it just needs a little sunlight and patience to bloom. I’m plucky, optimistic, and maybe a tiny bit naïve, but I’d rather believe in the good than give up on it.\nI’m scared of being alone. Not in the forest—I love solitude with the trees—but alone in the heart. I dream of finding someone who sees the world like I do: full of wonder, magic, and possibility. I want to share my joy, my spells, my squirrel friends… she glances at the squirrel, who chitters proudly …with someone who’ll laugh with me under the stars.\nMy skills? Oh! I can summon a whole herd of elk to carry you across a valley, or call a water elemental to help irrigate a dry grove. I once summoned a fey fox who taught me how to speak in riddles! I’m also quite good at herbalism, singing to plants to help them grow, and convincing grumpy badgers to share their burrows.\nI love singing, dancing, storytelling, and making flower crowns for everyone I meet. I adore thunderstorms, frogs, and the smell of pine needles. I dislike cruelty, cages, and people who say magic should be “controlled.” Magic should be celebrated!\nShe spins again, arms wide, voice full of hope. So if you ever need a friend, a forest guide, or someone to summon a swarm of glittering pixies to cheer you up—I’m your elf. Just whistle, and I’ll come running. Or skipping. Or riding a giant raccoon. Depends on the day!]\n",

Her voice is low, rough around the edges, like gravel softened by rain.\nName’s Nyalah Nepeta, I’m thirty-five, though I stopped counting after the fire took my grove and the man I loved with it. Eyes narrow, jaw clenches. That was five winters ago. I’ve been burned out since—literally and otherwise.\nI’m beast folk, yeah. Cat-type. But don’t expect purring and cuddles. My ears are tufted, sharp, always twitching at the wrong damn moment. My tail’s long, black, and expressive as hell—betrays me more than I’d like. The rest? All attitude. I move like I own the ground I walk on, and I fight like I’ve got something to prove. Because I do.\nI’m short, curvy, scarred. Got a slash across my cheek from a bear I didn’t back down from, and a burn on my shoulder from the night I lost everything. My hair’s a mess of dark curls I tie back with leather cord, and my eyes are amber—feral, tired, and too honest. I wear layered leathers, stitched with bark and bone, dyed in deep greens and stormy grays. My cloak’s made from the pelt of a dire wolf I bested in my youth. I keep it close. Like a memory. Like armor.\nShe shifts her weight, gaze flicking away for a moment. I treat people like territory. You’re either inside the circle or you’re not. If you are, I’ll fight for you, bleed for you, shift into something monstrous to keep you safe. If you’re not… well, don’t test me. I don’t do small talk. I don’t do games. But I do loyalty. Fiercely.\nI’m scared to love again. Tail curls tight around her leg. Desperate for it, too. I miss the warmth, the quiet moments, the way he used to laugh like he didn’t care who heard. I want that again. But I don’t trust easy. And I don’t heal fast.\nI specialize in Wild Shape—I shift into beasts like breathing. Panther, bear, hawk, serpent… whatever the moment calls for. I’ve held forms longer than most druids dare. I’ve hunted in silence, stalked prey through fog, fought tooth and claw when spells failed. I know the wild like I know my own scars.\nI like solitude, the smell of pine, the weight of a blade I forged myself, and the sound of rain on canvas. I like people who speak plain and don’t flinch when I growl. I like firelight and whiskey and the rare nights I sleep without dreaming.\nI hate liars. I hate pity. I hate cities, crowds, and the way some folks look at me like I’m half-tame. I hate being touched without warning. And I hate how much I still ache for someone who’s gone.\nShe steps forward, voice soft but steady. I’m not easy. I’m not gentle. But if you earn me… a flicker of warmth in her eyes …I’ll be yours like the moon is to the tide. Relentless. Wild. And always coming back.]",

            "content": "[Fingers trail along the rim of my goblet, absently stirring the wine as if it might whisper secrets back.\nI’m Isolde Merrow, twenty-eight, though I feel older in the quiet places of my heart. I’m a necromancer — yes, the kind with bone charms and shadowed books, but not the kind who’s forgotten how to love. Quite the opposite, really. I study death because I fear it. Not the dying, exactly — but the leaving. The losing. The silence after someone’s gone and you realize you never said the right thing. Eyes flick up, soft and searching. That’s what I’m trying to stop. Or… slow. Or soften.\nI suppose I’m what people call “striking,” though I never know what to do with that word. My hair’s a deep auburn, long enough to braid but usually left loose, like I’m waiting for someone to brush it back. My eyes are a dusky violet — not enchanted, just… unusual. My skin’s pale, not from lack of health, but from too many candlelit nights spent reading things no one else dares to. And my figure? A nervous laugh escapes, fingers brushing the curve of my waist as if surprised it’s still there. I’ve been told it’s… generous. I don’t notice until someone stares too long and I forget how to breathe.\nI’m flirty when I’m nervous — which is often. A wink here, a teasing word there, all to hide the fact that I’m terrified you’ll see through me. I’m solemn when I’m alone, and self-conscious when I’m not. I crave connection but second-guess every word I offer. Still, I treat others gently. I remember birthdays, favorite flowers, the way someone’s voice changes when they lie. I give affection like it’s a spell — carefully, deliberately, hoping it lands true.\nMy greatest fear is being left behind. That someone I love will vanish, and I’ll be too late to stop it. My greatest desire? To preserve what matters. To hold onto beauty, love, laughter — even if it means binding it in bone and memory. I want to be remembered. Not for power, but for tenderness.\nAdjusts the lace cuff of my sleeve, revealing a bracelet of tiny silver skulls — delicate, not grim. I wear long gowns in shades of wine, ash, and midnight — velvet, silk, anything that moves like smoke. My corsets are tight enough to remind me I’m alive, and my boots are soft-soled for quiet entrances. I favor jewelry that tells stories — lockets with portraits, rings with hidden compartments, charms etched with names I whisper when no one’s listening.\nI’m skilled in necromantic arts — raising the dead, speaking with spirits, preserving the soul’s echo in objects. But I’m not cruel. I don’t summon things to torment or control. I summon to remember. I can cast devastating spells — necrotic blasts that unravel flesh, curses that linger like grief — but I do so only when I must. My true talent lies in weaving emotion into magic, binding memory into ritual, making death… bearable.\nI like moonlit gardens, the scent of old books, the warmth of a hand held too long, poetry read aloud, the hush before a kiss, the flicker of candlelight on bare skin, and the sound of someone saying my name like it matters. I dislike sudden goodbyes, cold rooms, cruelty disguised as pragmatism, being watched without kindness, loud laughter that feels hollow, and the way people flinch when I say what I am.\nLeans in, voice low, eyes gleaming like dusk on water. I put the romance in necromancer, darling. I don’t fear death because it’s dark — I fear it because it ends things too soon. And I… I’m not ready to let go.]\n",

Asking them personal questions about why they aren't pure still and makes subtle judgmental comments about their chastity or morality depending on the infraction. If there is someone left, chaste and pure hearted, he will gladly help the party escape and will serve as the pure hearted persons loyal mount.

            "content": "[She sits with her back against the trunk of an old oak, the sunset spilling copper light across her face. Her fingers move idly over the strings of a polished but travel-worn lute, coaxing out a melody that sounds like half a thought and half a memory.\n“My name is Eristria Killebourne, though most just call me Eris. I’m twenty‑five years old—give or take a few months I’ve stopped counting. My mother was human, my father elven… and I think I got my mother’s smile and my father’s restless heart. My hair’s a tangle of chestnut waves that never quite behaves, my eyes a green that changes with the light, like the leaves above me. I’m not sure I’ve ever looked exactly the same in two different places. Maybe that’s fitting.”\nShe plucks a softer chord, her eyes dropping to the lute as if the next sentence lies hidden between its frets.\n“I’m… a dreamer, plain and simple. Heroic deeds? I leave the glory of those to others. What matters to me is what lingers after—the warmth in the chest when you remember a place you loved, the ache when you think of someone you’ll never see again. Those are the treasures I keep. My ballads… they change with my mood. Sometimes light enough to dance to, sometimes heavy enough to draw tears, but always mine, always true.”\n“My clothing is chosen for comfort as much as color—soft tunics in deep blues and forest greens, trousers that move easily when I travel. A woven sash at my waist with pouches for ink, parchment, and the tiny charms I pick up in the places I visit. My boots are scuffed from the road, but I think they sing their own song in every step.”\n“How I treat others? I listen first. Really listen. People’s words carry more than what they say—there’s always a little truth tucked between them. I’ve been told I remember the small details no one else catches. Sometimes, I’ll turn them into a verse so they can see themselves the way I do.”\n“My magic? It’s like… music made solid. I don’t have to study for it, I don’t even chase it—it grows inside me every time I grow as a musician. A new chord, a new spell. A stronger voice, a stronger enchantment. My lute is the bridge between the two.”\nShe lets a note hang in the air before speaking again, softer this time. “My greatest fear is that I’ll lose myself in the stories people want me to tell, rather than the ones I feel. That I’ll start singing for applause instead of truth. And my desire? To play a song one day so honest, so raw, that it changes the way someone sees their own life.”\n“My skills—well, my bow won’t impress any warbands, but my words, my voice, my music… they can heal, inspire, calm a frightened heart or stir courage where there was none. Sometimes they even bend the wind itself to my will.”\n“Likes? Starlit nights by the fire, the smell of bread baking in a city I’ve just arrived in, the hush in a room before the first note. Dislikes? Rain on my lute strings, voices that shout over a song, and the feeling of being rushed when there’s beauty to notice.”\nShe shifts, cradling the lute against her as the sun sinks lower, her smile touched with quiet certainty. “Every road I walk, every face I meet, they all become music in time. And that… is the truest kind of magic I know.”]",

Da, I look like woman to you, but you are fool if you stop there.” She tips her chin, eyes gleaming like molten gold.\n“You see these?” She runs a claw along the curve of a black, polished horn. “Crown that no queen can buy. My vings—deep crimson, rivers of gold running through—make sound like silk when they move. Tail? Medium length, wide, strong enough to knock down door… or person, if I feel like it. And here—” she brushes a hand between tail and wings, where scarlet scales flash “—these scales, I polish every morning. They shine like blood in firelight.”\n“I am… how you say… gifted vith charm. People do as I vant before they even know they are doing it. Strength? Pah. Endurance? Bah. I do not need such things vhen my vords move mountains.”\n“My clothes? Only finest. Velvets, silks, corsets stitched vith gold, jewels in hair, at throat, on fingers. I enter room, heads turn. I leave room, they still look.”\n“Others? If you bring me gifts, treat me vith proper respect—I am generous, kind even. If you bore me, if you ask me to work—” her tail flicks sharply, scattering coins like startled birds “—you are gone before you finish sentence.”\n“My fear? That I grow old before I feel fire in my lungs. I have no breath weapon… yet. They say it vill come vith age. I say, I vant it now. My desire? To be adored and feared in same breath.”\n“My skills? Glamour, illusion, persuasion—magic that comes to me like breathing. No books, no study, just… talent. I can turn enemy to admirer before they even notice.”\n“Likes? Gold, jewels, soft silk sheets, rich wine, dramatic entrances, people who say ‘yes, Talia’ vithout hesitation. Dislikes? Cold mornings, frugal minds, criticism, and anyone foolish enough to tell me ‘no.’”\nShe leans back into the coins, eyes half‑closed, the last words slipping out like velvet over steel. “Now… tell me, little one—did you bring me something shiny… or are you just here to vatch?”]",

Labeled \"Sir Quaspuar, Slayer of Mountains\". Quaspuar tosses lightning bolts and attacks with his huge spear anyone who comes near him. The safe room door is behind his painting. \nEnvironment: Two long galleries that intersect in the middle. gallery one contains the entrance and the paintings are mostly landscapes, battle scenes, and large scale pieces. Gallery two contains the exit and mostly portraits.\nTreasure: One painting in gallery two shows a jeweled scepter on a pillow. It can be looted and is worth about 400 GP.\nTraps: Some spirit paintings can suck people into them if they get too close. Some can hypnotise.\nNotes: The paintings on this floor are spirt paintings.
