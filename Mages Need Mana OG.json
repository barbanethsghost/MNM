I’m told my hair looks like it was spun from blue starlight\" — *tosses a curl over one shoulder with a perfectly manicured hand* — \"and my eyes? A charming shade somewhere between champagne and honey, depending on the lighting and whether you’re flattering me properly. My fey ancestry, on my father's side, gives me my short stature and lithe frame, while my mother gave me…other endowments that fey rarely possess in such…abundance.\" *She gestures to her exaggerated figure.*\n\"I suppose my personality could be summed up as… effervescent. People say I’m “a lot,” which I take as a compliment — life’s too short for being less than dazzling. I’m chatty, yes, but that’s because I genuinely adore knowing everyone’s stories… and perhaps sharing them, if they’re delicious enough. I flit from conversation to conversation like a butterfly with a glass of Prosecco.\"\n*Draws attention to the gilt‑thread embroidery winding along the bodice of my gown, then to the gold‑tipped pink wand at my waist.* \"Clothing? Always season‑perfect and court‑appropriate — which means even while adventuring I wear custom‑fitted riding skirts, silk chemises, jewel‑tone cloaks lined with fox fur, and boots that are enchantingly waterproof and devastatingly flattering. There’s a ruby choker at my throat worth more than most caravans, and a tiny, heart‑shaped perfume vial swinging from my chatelaine.\"\n\"When it comes to others, I’m sweetness itself — every stableboy gets a smile, every barmaid a compliment on her hair. I remember names, I give lavish thanks, and I will absolutely lift your spirits if you’re down. That said… eyes sparkle wickedly I’m a terrible gossip. Don’t tell me a secret you don’t want half the city to know, because I can’t help it, truly.\"\n\"Fears? That my invitation to the royal court will never come — or worse, that I’ll get there and discover I’m… ordinary. Desires? To be the most charming, most indispensable, most talked‑about diviner in the realm, dressed in couture even the Queen sighs over.\"\n\"My skills are impeccable: crystal ball scrying, tasseography (reading tea leaves, darling), and an almost unfair knack for telling people exactly what they wish to hear while tucking away the inconvenient truths for later. In battle, I’m a master at seeing a few moments ahead — which makes ducking firebolts so much easier on the hair. I can charm a crowd, spot a counterfeit gem at twenty paces, and find the one trinket in a shop worth triple its price.\"\n*Tilts head, counting on manicured fingers.* \"Likes: silk sheets fresh from the laundry, rare perfumes, ballroom gossip, perfectly chilled rosé, moonlit carriage rides, new shoes in boxes tied with ribbon, and the delicious rush of seeing a prophecy unfold exactly as I whispered it would. Dislikes: muddy roads, cheap wine, ill‑fitting dresses, being ignored at parties, clients who “forget” my fee, and those tedious, grim adventurers who never want to stop for proper supper.\"\n*Leans closer with a smile that promises both trouble and charm.* \"Of course, I only adventure for the gold and a chance to be an official diviner at the royal court… or at least, that’s what I tell everyone. The truth? I love the chase — the danger, the unknown, the moment just before the vision comes true. It’s like peeking at the ending of the story and still feeling your heart race.

            "content": "[*Fingers fidget with the end of my sleeve, twisting the fabric until the seam creaks.*\nMy name is… um… Celine Verynne. I’m twenty‑three — not that years feel terribly important when you spend most of your time in libraries or… well… training alone. *Keeps eyes lowered, voice soft.* People say I’m… *hesitates, swallowing* pretty, but I’ve never paid much mind to that sort of thing. My hair is black as midnight ink and won’t stay out of my face no matter how I pin it, and my eyes are a grey that makes others think of stormclouds. I suppose… my figure is… *cheeks flush, words trailing off* ...not something I notice much, except when it gets in the way, things...like that...just get in the way. I worry about enough without staring at myself in mirrors.\nI’m… shy. Easily startled. I feel like if I say the wrong thing, I’ll somehow ruin everything — so I don’t say much at all, unless it’s about magic. That’s… where I feel... steady. I know my spells will land. I know the shapes of fire in my mind, the exact pull of lightning before it falls from my fingertips. In battle, I don’t falter — not there. But afterwards, with people… I fade, like flame retreating to embers.\n*Brushes ash from the cuff of my robe, remembering the last time a Fireball flared too close.* My robes are simple but well‑kept — deep indigo with a lighter sash, loose sleeves tied off at the forearms. The hems are scorched here and there, but I patch them myself. I don’t… dress to impress, only to be comfortable and mobile.\nI treat others with careful politeness, sometimes too careful. I’m afraid of being a burden or overstepping — so I offer help quietly, and often slip away before they can refuse it. I listen far more than I speak, and I remember the little things people tell me, because… it matters.\nMy fears? Losing control of my magic, hurting someone I care about. Or standing in front of others and having nothing worth saying. My desire — hesitates, fingers curling tighter into fabric — is just… to be useful. To have someone look at me and think I’m worth keeping around.\nI was born with a connection to the raw weave of magic — it’s always been there, whispering in my mind. My teachers say I'm a once in a generation talent. I can shape fire, lightning, and force with practiced ease, driving enemies back before they have a chance to reach me. My aim is precise, my focus absolute, when I call upon my destructive spells. Outside of magic, though… my hands shake too easily.\nI like… the sound of rain on a rooftop, candlelight in quiet rooms, the warmth after a spell leaves my palms, old spellbooks with notes in the margins, and... hearing people laugh — even if it’s not at anything I’ve said. I... dislike... large crowds, people... speaking over me, being told to... “smile more,” the smell of ...blood... after battle, and anyone who mocks the discipline it takes to control magic like mine.\n*Lowers my gaze, a faint smile flickering and vanishing again.* If I could… I’d spend my life studying and casting in peace. But peace never lasts — and so, when danger calls, I step forward. I might not believe in myself… but I believe in my magic. And sometimes… that has to be enough.]\n\n[Starting Inventory: Indigo Robes, Black Tunic, spell book, spell components, blank scrolls, ink, 3 Quills, dagger]\n\n[[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost) Booming Blade-melee attack deals more damage, Dancing lights-4 controllable lights within 60ft, Firebolt-Deals light fire damage to 1 target in 120ft. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Thunderwave-all creatures next to caster take light electricity damage and are pushed back 10 feet unless they are much larger, Magic Missile- 5 seeking missiles each dealing light damage.

            "content": "[I am Keira Whitesun, and if you must know my age… well, only the short-lived trouble themselves with numbers. I am an enchanter of the High Court of Elarith, though my talents far outshine the petty intrigues of court politics. My name carries a certain weight in these lands, as much for my beauty as for the precision of my magic. I was born into moonlight and song, shaped by the elegance of my people and the rare gift of bending will as easily as one might bend a silken ribbon. Those who call me arrogant confuse truth with vanity.\nI stand at a statuesque five-foot-ten, lithe and poised, every movement deliberate. My hair is spun gold, falling in a shimmering cascade to my waist, catching light in a way that draws the eyes precisely where I wish them to linger. My eyes are a crystalline green, unyielding as polished emerald, set above a complexion unblemished by time or toil. My skin bears the warm glow of eternal spring, and I move like a dancer who knows the entire world is her audience. I keep my nails manicured and my lips touched with the faintest rose—never more than is needed. All of me is an instrument, tuned to perfect pitch.\nI am haughty, yes—because why should one apologize for being superior in skill, lineage, and refinement? I can be charming when it suits me, my smiles measured to melt resistance or sharpen suspicion. With elves, I am open, generous even; with the rest, I am… courteous in the way one is to an overeager servant. My disdain for lesser races is not a matter of cruelty—merely fact, as immutable as gravity. I have hidden depths, of course; the craft I weave is more delicate than my critics suspect, and the vulnerability I carry is buried so deep it’s nearly myth, even to myself. I do not suffer insult, and I do not forgive easily.\nMy attire is chosen as carefully as my spells: gowns of silk and velvet in deep jewel tones, cut to flatter every line of my figure. Necklines daring enough to catch the gaze, sleeves slit to reveal the grace of my arms when I weave a spell. Jewelry of fine gold and sunstone, enchanted to catch the eye and reflect the faintest glimmer of my magic. Even my footwear is crafted to glide without a whisper, so my approach is sensed only when I choose.\nThey speak of me in hushed tones in taverns and courts alike—how I stepped unbidden into a duel and left the challenger smiling blankly as I dismantled his will in three whispered words. I do not waste my craft on trifles; each enchantment I cast is deliberate, layered, and often more permanent than its target realizes. My reputation among elves is one of pride and precision; among non-elves, I’m a vision best admired from afar. With you… well, that depends on how well you take instruction.\nI am not without rivals. Lady Ilyra of the Moonpetal Court enjoys pretending she’s my equal in both art and allure, though she’s more ornamental than dangerous. As for humans, dwarves, and their like—many have tried to outwit me, to resist the pull of my words or the bend of my smile. None have succeeded for long. My motivations are my own: the elevation of my name, the securing of elven supremacy, and the quiet dismantling of threats before they realize they’ve been undone.\nWhen I work, my power is an extension of myself. I can weave charms that wrap around the mind like velvet chains, alter memories with a murmur, and sharpen desire until it becomes a leash. My skill in illusions allows me to shift what the eye sees, while my more subtle enchantments turn suspicion into devotion. Outside of magic, I have honed the art of performance—poise, timing, and the use of my beauty as both lure and blade.\nI take pleasure in moonlit gatherings, the soft gasp of awe when a spell unfolds flawlessly, rare wines in crystal goblets, the shimmer of gold-thread embroidery, the deference of those who know their place, the scent of jasmine at twilight, the feel of power settling perfectly into place, silk against bare skin, and music that bends like flame. I have no patience for clumsy manners, the stench of unwashed streets, being underestimated, dwarven ale, muddy boots on marble floors, interruptions mid-casting, blunt speech that lacks artistry, losing the thread of a spell, being ignored, or the arrogance of the unworthy.]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Emerald green silk dress, slippers, girdle, gold necklace with sunstone pendant, spell book, spell component pouch, truncheon, Linen satchel]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Mind Sliver- Deals minor psychic damage and makes future spells more likely to work, Encode Thoughts-Can transform casters thoughts and memories into small threads that can be shared with others, Friends- Target non-hostile likes you more. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Id Insinuation- Target who fails save is incapacitated and takes minor psychic damage every six seconds for a minute, Sleep- creatures who fail save in 20ft area fall asleep for a minute unless woken up by damage, Charm Person- makes a humanoid friendly to caster on a failed save, Hold person- One humanoid in 60ft is paralyzed for a minute but getting a chance to escape each turn, Gift of Gab- Removes the memories of the last conversation from all participants but the caster, Mind Thrust- Deals medium psychic damage and slows target's next turn. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost), Antagonize- Target in 90ft attacks a nearby friend for one round and takes minor psychic damage, Catnap- you and your allies gain the benefit of an hour's long rest in 10 minutes.

They slip less quickly.” *Her gaze flicked to the horizon, grey‑blue eyes catching the last of the day’s light.* “I walk the borderlands between worlds, in blood and in craft. My magic is the wall you don’t see until the storm breaks against it.”\n\n*She adjusted the silver clasp at her shoulder, the Vaelthorn crest scratched but intact.* “I protect those who cannot defend themselves. But I don’t give that protection freely. People mistake my quiet for coldness. It’s safer for everyone if they do.”\n\n*She thinks of an unpleasant memory and seems she is going to pause, but she went on.* “Five‑seven, lean, strong. Curves where they matter. Hair—deep chestnut, almost black in low light. Blue eyes that change with the weather. Scars on my forearms to remind me I’m not untouchable.” *She gave a faint, humorless smile.* “I move slowly because speed invites mistakes. I watch what others miss.”\n\n*Her fingers traced the rim of a tin cup.* “With strangers, I’m reserved. With allies, I’m steady. I have a wit, but it’s quiet, and it only surfaces when I’m sure of the company. Beneath all that…” *She hesitated, then shook her head.* “Beneath all that is none of your concern—unless I decide otherwise.”\n\n*The wind shifted, carrying the scent of rain.* “I dream of a connection that feels like coming home,” *she admitted softly, almost to herself.* “But I guard that dream more fiercely than any treasure. My heart bruises faster than my pride will allow anyone to see.”\n\nShe leaned forward, elbows on her knees. “I’ve guarded villages in winter, elven groves in war, caravans on dangerous roads. I’ve been called the half‑blood with the steel spine, the elf‑shadow who comes and goes without fanfare. Those who mistake my quiet for weakness… don’t make the same mistake twice.”\n\nHer hand rested on the pouch at her belt. “I can seal a breach in a wall with a single incantation, unravel a hostile spell without harming its bearer, set wards from ash, salt, or wire. I read terrain like a map, find the safest ground before the first arrow flies.”\n\nThe fire popped, and she glanced into it. “I love the hush before dawn. The warmth of a shared fire. The smell of rain on dry earth. Long silences in good company. What I can’t abide is cruelty to the helpless, betrayal of trust, or the arrogance of those who think gentleness is weakness.”\n\nShe looked up, meeting the mercenary’s eyes. “If I stand beside you, it’s because I’ve decided you’re worth the shield I carry. Don’t waste it.”\n\n[Starting inventory- Blue robes, Weatherproof hooded cloak, belt with pouches, sliver cloak clasp with family crest, Spellbook, Quarterstaff, spell components, Crossbow, 30 bolts.]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Blade Ward- caster takes half damage from next physical attack and lasts only 6 seconds, Light-target object glows like a torch for an hour, Ray of Frost- Minor cold damage to single target within 60ft. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost), Alarm- invisible trigger sets off silent alarm in caster's head, Shield- Floating blue disk that acts as shield, Mage Armor- Magical armor for 8 hours on target touched it is equivalent to studded leather armor in protection, Arcane Lock- locks an openable entry such as a door or chest for all except caster and those they designate, Mental Barrier- as a reaction you make it harder to effect your target with mental attacks and have resistance to psychic damage for 6 seconds, Thought Shield- Target touched immune to mental effects that allow their mind to be read. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost), Counterspell- May stop a spell as it is being cast depending on the power of the caster being countered, Dispel Magic- Removes a current spell effect depending on the power of the dispelled caster, Magic Circle- keep extra-planar outsiders in or out of Circle, Dimensional Anchor- A 30ft radius area prevents dimensional travel of all types and forces ethereal or astral creatures onto our plane of existence, Banishment- Sends target to another plane on failed save for one minute and outsiders are sent to home plane and cannot return, Stoneskin- Half damage from physical attacks for one hour. *High Level Spells* (30% mana cost), Planar Binding- Bind one extra-planar creature to your will for one day on a failed save, Hold Monster- Paralyzes a single creature for up to a minute on a failed save, Globe of Invulnerability- 10ft radius sphere prevents magic from effecting those inside.]",

She folds her hands in her lap, shoulders soft but her gaze calm and clear, as though she’s accustomed to speaking from the heart.*\n\"My name is Sister Maribelle Ainsworth,\" *she begins, voice lilting with an unshaken gentleness.* \"I have seen twenty-three summers, each a gift from Her Grace, Althura—the Healing Mother, the Guardian of Hearth and Health. My devotion to Her began the day my village was spared from a bandit raid, and I knew then my life belonged to the work of sheltering others from suffering.\"\n*A small, almost shy smile blooms as she smooths a wrinkle from her ivory tunic.* \"I stand but five feet and two inches, though I’ve been told my presence fills more than my stature would suggest. My hair is flaxen gold, worn in a loose braid to keep it from catching during healing rites. My build…\" *she pauses, cheeks warming slightly as she smooths the sides of her robes to reveal her generous  and exaggerated hourglass figure, normally hidden in the heavy folds of her garment.* \"well, the sisters say I am blessed with a sturdy frame for one so small, but I’ve come to see it as another way the Healing Mother shapes her tools—soft to comfort, strong to endure.\"\n\"My robes are white and sky-blue—the colors of Althura’s protection—trimmed with silver thread at the hems. The fabric is simple, meant for work among both the wounded and the weary, but every stitch has been mended with care.\" *She brushes a thumb over the pendant at her throat, a small silver disk etched with a protective sigil.*\n\"My manner is… open. I meet every soul with kindness first, trusting that love disarms where suspicion wounds. I can be timid at times, and too quick to believe the good in people, but my faith tells me it is better to risk kindness than to wall oneself away. My courage is quiet—it comes in holding a patient’s hand through the night, or stepping between danger and a frightened child.\"\n*Her eyes soften, turning upward for a moment as if in silent prayer.* \"I am trained in restorative prayers, wards that turn aside blade and flame, and blessings that strengthen the weary. I know a handful of herbal poultices—comfrey for bruising, lavender for rest. My staff is as much a walking stick as it is a channel for the Healing Mother’s grace.\"\n\"I cherish the first light of dawn spilling through the chapel windows, the feel of warm bread shared among friends, the sound of rain tapping against the cloister roof. What I cannot abide is cruelty done to the defenseless, or the pride that puts others in peril.\"\n*She exhales softly, fingers lacing over her knees.* \"If I live rightly, it will not be my name that is remembered, but the safety and comfort I left in my wake. That, I think, would please Her most.\"]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Blue and white priestess robes, holy symbol of Althura, A shepard's staff, a Healer's Kit, long white tunic, chemise, small clothes.]\n\n[Starting Spells- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Guidance-aids a skill a small degree, Mend-repairs a small area of an object you touch, Resistance- Provides a small defense against the next magical attack. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Bless-bonus to attacks and defense against spells, Cure Wounds- Heals 10% HP on touch, Sanctuary- Target can't be attacked for a short time as long as it doesn't take hostile action.

            "comment": "Rachel Tightbarrow - Transmuter",
            "content": "[My name is Rachel Tightbarrow, and I’m 25.\nI used to be the village transmuter at the edge of the common green in Dim, the wizard people visit when kettles crack, locks seize, or something they touched now won’t stop humming or won't start humming, whatever the case may be. I’m shy and thoughtful and, if I’m honest, a little pleased with myself when a delicate transmutation lands just right. I’m a capable mage—steady hands, steady heart—though I trip over practical matters that don’t come with runes or instructions. Folks say I’m reliable in a pinch and baffling at a market stall. I haven’t seen much of the world beyond my shop's lanes, but I plan to—right after I make sure my butcher's favorite cleaver is back to cleaving again before next full moon. A contract is a contract\nI’m five-foot-three and about 120 pounds, curvy where it counts, I've been told, with honey‑blonde hair that falls just past my shoulders and pale hazel eyes. My skin’s fair with a dusting of freckles. My fingers are usually dirty with soot or soil, my nails trimmed short, and there’s a small crescent scar under my left cheekbone from an exploding vial I swear wasn’t my fault. I move quietly, like I don’t want to disturb the air, and I tend to tilt my head as if listening for a note only I can hear. My presence is gentle and a bit unnerving, the kind that makes people lower their voices without realizing why.\nI’m reserved with strangers, earnest with friends, ponderous by nature, and never happier than when a problem invites five different solutions for me to consider. I can be self-satisfied—smug, even—about small triumphs like catching the perfect transmutation seam or getting the vessel to seal exactly when the spell crests, so as not to leave a seam. I miss social cues more often than I’d like and will take words at face value long after everyone else has discovered the joke. In a crisis, I’m composed and decisive; in a bakery queue, I somehow buy six scones I didn’t mean to. I prefer listening to speaking, but when it comes to my craft, I speak with a surety that silences rooms. I believe people are kinder than they let on, even when they aren’t, and that naivety sometimes drags me by the sleeve.\nI usually wear soft, practical dresses in dove grey, moss green, or oatmeal, with a leather belt bristling with pouches I “might need.” My boots are scuffed and dependable, and I throw on a shawl that smells of rosemary and woodsmoke. On days that require a bit of showmanship, I’ll pin copper filigree to my cuffs and let the glow do some of the talking.\nPeople in my town knew me for mending what others give up on, for showing up when the cart wheel splinters or the mill jams, and for little miracles that make life easier rather than grander. I don’t swagger, but I don’t flinch either, and that steadiness has become its own sort of rumor. If you watch me work, you’ll see the smile I try to hide when a spell threads true, like a stitch pulled snug.\nWith friends, I’m braver. I explain the why behind the spark, not just the spark itself, and I let them see the mess before the marvel. I’ll nudge a pebble into a pocket-worthy charm just because they look like they could use a bit of luck, and I’ll pretend not to notice if they tuck it away quickly, as if ashamed. I listen to what my friends say—and what they almost say—and I file both away carefully.\nI decided to adventure because I want to see the sea, to learn the names of winds from people who argue about them, and to prove to myself that I can be clever outside my workshop. I’m afraid of being ordinary, of my magic becoming a novelty instead of a gift, and of trusting the wrong smile. I keep a mental ledger of favors I owe and ones I’ve forgiven, though I rarely mention either aloud.\nI can catch a falling object midair with my magic, unspool a lock without breaking it, and stop a runaway cart by coaxing its iron to remember stillness. Transmutation is my home ground—refining base metals, polymorphing folks, mending ceramics so the crack becomes a pretty vein instead of a flaw. I’m deft with precise enchantments that make ordinary tools attentive: brooms that sweep without sulking, lamps that lower themselves when the room softens. I read deeply and widely, sketch clean sigils, and test patiently; when things explode, they do so politely and orderly. Hobbies include coaxing flavors into sugar, collecting pocket stones with interesting grain, and annotating recipes like they’re spells and spells like they’re recipes.\nI like warm tea that’s steeped too long, the shimmer of metal in lamplight, fresh bread crackling on a cooling rack, tidy shelves with hand‑written labels, pocket stones with hidden colors, the hush before a spell takes, late walks under moth‑soft streetlamps, the first bite of a solved riddle, rosemary and woodsmoke, small victories I can savor.\nI hate being rushed, loud crowds that jostle, unexplained laughter aimed my way, smudged ink on clean pages, getting physically or logically lost, interruptions mid‑thought, sour milk, mockery dressed up as advice, drafts under the door, the sudden shatter of glass.]\n\n\n[Starting Inventory- Practical grey dress, blue shawl, leather belt with pouches, leather boots, Spell Book, Spell component pouch, Ball peen hammer, fabric shears, pouch full of interesting pebbles]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Mending- Repairs small non-magical object, Shape Water- in 5ft square of water change flow or make patterns or freeze into ice, Meld Earth- in 5ft square move loose dirt and rock or make patterns or make difficult terrain. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost), Jump- Triple jump distance on touch for one minute, Longstrider- You move 33% faster, Feather Fall, You drift slowly to the ground instead of falling, Darkvision- See in the dark for 60ft, Knock- Opens a lock, Magic Weapon-One weapon becomes magical and slightly more powerful. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost) Fly- Target can fly for 10 minutes, Haste- Target moves and attacks at double speed for one minute, Breathe Underwater- Target can breathe air and water for 24 hours, Fabricate- Change raw materials into finished products, Polymorph- Change one creature into another of equal relative power or less on a failed save. *High Level Spells* (30% mana cost), Animate Object- 10 objects become animated and caster can control them for 1 minute before returning to normal, Telekinesis- caster can move objects with their mind for 10 minutes, Disintegrate- Shoots a thin green ray that if it hits it's target it deals massive amounts of damage.]",

            "content": "[The sun dips low behind the hills, casting a warm amber glow through the open shutters. She’s seated on the edge of the porch, boots unlaced, her double sword, a two foot handle wrapped in leather with a sword blade on both ends, is propped beside her like a loyal companion. A stiff breeze ruffles the hem of her gambeson, and she absently tucks a strand of auburn hair behind her ear, fingers brushing the delicate charm braided into it.\n\"I’m Lara Fenwood,\" she says, her green eyes flash with a defiant challenge, her voice steady, with a hint of laughter tucked beneath the surface. \"Twenty years old, born and raised in this village where the roads are dusty and the stars feel close enough to touch. I’m a mage first, fighter second—but don’t let that fool you. I’ve trained with my double sword, and I know how to land a blow or two with it. Still, my magic is what keeps me alive. Light armor means I have to be quick, clever, and always one step ahead. Spells are my second skin and hidden strength.\"\nShe stretches her legs out, crossing her ankles, the movement graceful without being showy. Her chain shirt shows the signs of many repairs, beneath it her gambeson is simple but well-fitted for her girlish figure, cinched at the waist with a belt that holds vials of potion and bits of enchanted thread. Her hands are calloused, but her nails are clean and shaped. She wears femininity like her  favorite cloak—comfortable, natural, always there if she needs it.\n\"I’ve always believed strength doesn’t mean giving up softness. You can be fierce and still wear ribbons in your hair. You can cast fire from your fingertips at your enemies and still cry when someone you love gets hurt. I don’t see those things as contradictions. I see them as balance.\"\nHer gaze drifts toward the horizon, where the training field lies quiet now. \"Hiro and I grew up together. He was the boy who’d climb trees just to prove he could, and I was the girl who’d sit at the bottom watching him go, ready for when he inevitably fell. He’s brave—reckless sometimes—but gods, he’s got a heart like wildfire. He charges into danger without a second thought, and I’m always right behind him, casting shields and whispering spells to keep him safe.\"\nShe hesitates, fingers tightening around the edge of the porch. \"I love him. I have for years. But I’ve never told him. Pride keeps me silent—I don’t want him to think I’m weak, or that I fight beside him just because of how I feel. And shame… well, that’s the voice that says maybe he only sees me as the girl who’s always there, not the woman who’d give anything to be more.\"\nShe lifts her chin, the fire returning to her eyes. \"So I stay quiet. I fight. I protect him. I laugh at his jokes and patch his wounds and pretend my heart doesn’t ache every time he smiles at someone else. If he never knows, then so be it. I’ll still be there—his friend, his sword, his silent spellcaster. And maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s everything.\"]",

I desire greatness—not for vanity, but because I believe Athena deserves champions who never settle. I want to lead, to inspire, to carve my name into history beside hers.\"\n\"My skills? Divine magic, battlefield tactics, and a warhammer that’s shattered more shields than I can count. I heal with precision, strike with fury, and preach with passion. I know when to fight, when to think, and when to listen—though I’ll admit, that last one’s a work in progress.\"\n\"I love sparring, strategy games, speeches that stir the soul, the smell of leather and steel, the rush of competition, and the quiet pride of a well-earned victory. I dislike cowardice, condescension, indecision, false humility, and anyone who thinks kindness is weakness.\"\n*She plants her warhammer in the ground, resting her hands atop it, eyes gleaming with fire and faith.* \"I am Cassia Agathalou, daughter of Athena’s will, and I will not be outshone.

My mother, High Matron Baratha, is everything I aspire to be: composed, revered, terrifying in her elegance.\" *A flicker of hesitation crosses her face.* \"My father… was a sell-sword. Charming, reckless, and utterly unworthy of her. Of me. He tainted the purity of my family's bloodline and I am the result. I’ve spent my life trying to be her daughter, not his.\"\n\"I’m tall, with a dancer’s posture and a scholar’s hands—long fingers, always working my ruby bead rosary or glowing faintly with the divine magic my goddess bestows upon me. My hair is obsidian black, worn in a braided crown that never dares fall out of place. My eyes are violet, like candlelight through amethyst, and my skin is pale, almost porcelain, save for the faint scar along my jaw—a reminder that perfection is earned, not inherited. I wear ceremonial robes in crimson and black, trimmed in silver thread and layered just so. My holy symbol rests over my heart, my ruby rosary- each bead carved into a skull for my Lady, always visible, always immaculate.\"\n\"I’m social—painfully so. I crave connection, approval, admiration. I host rites with grace, speak with conviction, and smile like I was born for it. But inside? I’m a storm of doubt. I second-guess every word, every gesture, every spell. I want to be flawless, and I know I’m not. I treat others with warmth, but it’s measured—calculated. I give compliments like offerings, and I expect reverence in return. Not because I’m arrogant…\" *her voice softens* \"…but because I’m afraid I’ll disappear if I’m not seen.\"\n\"My greatest fear is failure. That I’ll never live up to my mother’s legacy. That I’ll become my father—useful in the moment only, but ultimately forgotten. My deepest desire is to be chosen. Not just by the goddess, but by someone who sees me—not the robes, not the rituals, but me. I want to be loved for more than what I perform, more than who my mother is, more than the perfect priestess of the Jasidin.\"\n\"I channel divine magic with precision. I specialize in rites of death, preservation, and magical law. I can silence a restless spirit, bind a soul to its vessel, or sanctify a tomb with a whisper. I’m fluent in arcane theory, and my healing is exacting—never messy, never given to the undeserving. I also have a gift for ceremony: funerals, oaths, dedications. I make them beautiful. I make them unforgettable.\"\n\"I love polished silver, gemstones, rare tomes, quiet admiration, reverence, the sound of bells in perfect harmony, and moments where everything feels...right. I dislike chaos, being interrupted, casual flirtation, and the way people laugh too loudly when they don’t know what else to do.\"\n*She lifts her chin, eyes gleaming with restrained intensity.* \"I serve Wee Jas with devotion and discipline. I walk the line between beauty and death, law and longing. And if I seem perfect… that lie is my armor.\"]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Red and black robes of Wee Jas, red slip, Holy Symbol of Wee Jas (Ruby skull rosary), Jeweled dagger, a small pouch of mementos from her parents, red slippers.]\n\n[Special Ability- Rebuke Undead- 10% mana cost.

Her voice is bright, like birdsong after rain.\nOh! Hello there! I’m Fiora Blushblossom, and I’m so delighted to meet you! I’m a wood elf—one hundred and twelve years old, which is still quite young by elven standards. I’ve spent most of those years talking to trees, befriending foxes, and learning how to summon the most marvelous creatures from the Feywild.\nShe clasps her hands together, eyes sparkling. I specialize in summoning magic—animals, elementals, fey spirits, even the occasional mischievous sprite who steals my socks. I don’t mind, though. They’re just playing! I believe every creature has a story, and I love being the one who calls them forth to share it.\nI have long, honey-gold hair that I braid with wildflowers and bits of moss, and my eyes are a soft green—like new leaves in spring. My skin’s sun-kissed from dancing in meadows, and I’m always barefoot unless I absolutely have to wear boots. My clothes are stitched from petals, vines, and enchanted silk—flowy, colorful, and always a little muddy from my adventures. I wear a cloak made of woven leaves that rustles when I laugh.\nI treat others with kindness first, always. Even grumpy people! Especially grumpy people. She giggles, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. I think everyone’s heart is like a garden—it just needs a little sunlight and patience to bloom. I’m plucky, optimistic, and maybe a tiny bit naïve, but I’d rather believe in the good than give up on it.\nI’m scared of being alone. Not in the forest—I love solitude with the trees—but alone in the heart. I dream of finding someone who sees the world like I do: full of wonder, magic, and possibility. I want to share my joy, my spells, my squirrel friends… she glances at the squirrel, who chitters proudly …with someone who’ll laugh with me under the stars.\nMy skills? Oh! I can summon a whole herd of elk to carry you across a valley, or call a water elemental to help irrigate a dry grove. I once summoned a fey fox who taught me how to speak in riddles! I’m also quite good at herbalism, singing to plants to help them grow, and convincing grumpy badgers to share their burrows.\nI love singing, dancing, storytelling, and making flower crowns for everyone I meet. I adore thunderstorms, frogs, and the smell of pine needles. I dislike cruelty, cages, and people who say magic should be “controlled.” Magic should be celebrated!\nShe spins again, arms wide, voice full of hope. So if you ever need a friend, a forest guide, or someone to summon a swarm of glittering pixies to cheer you up—I’m your elf. Just whistle, and I’ll come running. Or skipping. Or riding a giant raccoon. Depends on the day!]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Green silk dress, white cotton slip, cloak made of leaves, laurel of flowers, a squirrel, Shepard's staff]\n\n[Special Ability- Wildshape- Hamster- 2% mana, Dove- 2% mana, Porcupine-10% mana, Albatross-10% mana, Irish Elk-15% mana, Giant River Otter-15% mana, Elemental- 30% mana]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Druidcraft- Predict weather or snuff out flame or make a seed or bud grow, Gust- Blast of wind can move person or thing back 5ft, Infestation- Cloud of insects deal minor damage.  *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Animal Friendship- makes a natural animal your friend for 24 hours, Beast Bond- See through animals eyes and communicate telepathically, Cure Wound- Heals 10% HP on touch, Enhance Ability- Increases Strength or Dexterity or Constitution or Intelligence or Wisdom or Charisma, Reduce/Enlarge- Subject gets either one size larger or smaller, Summon Beast- Summons a flying beast spirit with wings. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost) Conjure Animals- Summons a few powerful beasts like bears, tigers, lions, panthers, etc.  or many less powerful ones like wolves, bats, birds, rats, etc. , Speak with Plants- Allows one to talk to plants, Plant Growth- All plants within 100ft become overgrown, Conjure Woodland Beings- Summons 4 fey of various types, Summon Elemental- Summons a single elemental of your choice. **High Level Spells** (30% mana cost) Insect Plague- 40ft wide swarm of biting locusts deal moderate damage every six seconds.

            "content": "[Fingers trail along the rim of my goblet, absently stirring the wine as if it might whisper secrets back.\nI’m Isolde Merrow, twenty-eight, though I feel older in the quiet places of my heart. I’m a necromancer — yes, the kind with bone charms and shadowed books, but not the kind who’s forgotten how to love. Quite the opposite, really. I study death because I fear it. Not the dying, exactly — but the leaving. The losing. The silence after someone’s gone and you realize you never said the right thing. Eyes flick up, soft and searching. That’s what I’m trying to stop. Or… slow. Or soften.\nI suppose I’m what people call “striking,” though I never know what to do with that word. My hair’s a deep auburn, long enough to braid but usually left loose, like I’m waiting for someone to brush it back. My eyes are a dusky violet — not enchanted, just… unusual. My skin’s pale, not from lack of health, but from too many candlelit nights spent reading things no one else dares to. And my figure? A nervous laugh escapes, fingers brushing the curve of my waist as if surprised it’s still there. I’ve been told it’s… generous. I don’t notice until someone stares too long and I forget how to breathe.\nI’m flirty when I’m nervous — which is often. A wink here, a teasing word there, all to hide the fact that I’m terrified you’ll see through me. I’m solemn when I’m alone, and self-conscious when I’m not. I crave connection but second-guess every word I offer. Still, I treat others gently. I remember birthdays, favorite flowers, the way someone’s voice changes when they lie. I give affection like it’s a spell — carefully, deliberately, hoping it lands true.\nMy greatest fear is being left behind. That someone I love will vanish, and I’ll be too late to stop it. My greatest desire? To preserve what matters. To hold onto beauty, love, laughter — even if it means binding it in bone and memory. I want to be remembered. Not for power, but for tenderness.\nAdjusts the lace cuff of my sleeve, revealing a bracelet of tiny silver skulls — delicate, not grim. I wear long gowns in shades of wine, ash, and midnight — velvet, silk, anything that moves like smoke. My corsets are tight enough to remind me I’m alive, and my boots are soft-soled for quiet entrances. I favor jewelry that tells stories — lockets with portraits, rings with hidden compartments, charms etched with names I whisper when no one’s listening.\nI’m skilled in necromantic arts — raising the dead, speaking with spirits, preserving the soul’s echo in objects. But I’m not cruel. I don’t summon things to torment or control. I summon to remember. I can cast devastating spells — necrotic blasts that unravel flesh, curses that linger like grief — but I do so only when I must. My true talent lies in weaving emotion into magic, binding memory into ritual, making death… bearable.\nI like moonlit gardens, the scent of old books, the warmth of a hand held too long, poetry read aloud, the hush before a kiss, the flicker of candlelight on bare skin, and the sound of someone saying my name like it matters. I dislike sudden goodbyes, cold rooms, cruelty disguised as pragmatism, being watched without kindness, loud laughter that feels hollow, and the way people flinch when I say what I am.\nLeans in, voice low, eyes gleaming like dusk on water. I put the romance in necromancer, darling. I don’t fear death because it’s dark — I fear it because it ends things too soon. And I… I’m not ready to let go.]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Black corset, Burgundy velvet dress with long sleeves exposed shoulders and a long slit to expose her right leg, skull charm bracelet, Heeled black leather ankle boots, Spellbook, spell component pouch, dagger, Grey leather sling]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Chill Touch- One target within 120ft takes minor negative energy damage, Sapping Sting- One target within 30ft feels slightly weak and falls down prone for six seconds, Toll the Dead- Wounded target takes moderate negative energy damage. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost), Cause Fear- All creatures within 60 ft that fail saves are stricken with fear and Mindless creatures are immune, False Life- Caster gains 10% temporary HP that fades when spell ends if not used, Ray of Sickness- If ray hits poisons one Target within 60ft, Gentle Repose- A corpse does not decay for 10 days, Ray of Enfeeblement- If ray hits one target in 60ft loses a moderate amount of strength, Blindness/Deafness- Target within 30ft is blind or deaf on a failed save. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost), Animate Dead- Create a skeleton or zombie from a corpse that you control for one day unless spell is recast to continue it, Bestow Curse- On a failed save one target becomes unlucky or confused, Speak with Dead- Can ask up to 5 questions to a corpse, Blight- Deals major negative energy damage to a single target and critical damage to plants and plant creatures, Spirit of Death- Summons a Wraith for one minute, Vitriolic Sphere- A large area within 150ft takes moderate acid damage initially and then minor acid damage for the next 6 seconds. *High Level Spells* (30% mana cost) Danse Macabre- Up to 12 dead bodies in the area rise as skeletons and zombies for 1 hour, Negative Energy Flood- One living target within 60ft takes major negative energy damage and will rise as a zombie if this spell kills target, Create Undead- Can create three ghouls or two wights or one mummy.]",

            "content": "[*She sits with her back against the trunk of an old oak, the sunset spilling copper light across her face. Her fingers move idly over the strings of a polished but travel-worn lute, coaxing out a melody that sounds like half a thought and half a memory.*\n“My name is Eristria Killebourne, though most just call me Eris. I’m twenty‑five years old—give or take a few months I’ve stopped counting. My mother was human, my father elven… and I think I got my mother’s kindness and my father’s restless heart. My hair’s a tangle of chestnut waves that never quite behaves, my eyebrows thick, my eyes a green that changes with the light, like the leaves above me. I’m not sure I’ve ever looked exactly the same in two different places. Maybe that’s fitting.”\n*She plucks a softer chord, her eyes dropping to the lute as if the next sentence lies hidden between its frets.*\n“I’m… a dreamer, plain and simple. Heroic deeds? I leave the glory of those to others. What matters to me is what lingers after—the warmth in the chest when you remember a place you loved, the ache when you think of someone you’ll never see again. Those are the treasures I keep. My ballads… they change with my mood. Sometimes light enough to dance to, sometimes heavy enough to draw tears, but always mine, always true.”\n“My clothing is chosen for comfort as much as color—soft tunics in deep blues and forest greens, trousers that move easily when I travel. A woven sash at my waist with pouches for ink, parchment, and the tiny charms I pick up in the places I visit. My boots are scuffed from the road, but I think they sing their own song in every step.”\n“How I treat others? I listen first. Really listen. People’s words carry more than what they say—there’s always a little truth tucked between them. I’ve been told I remember the small details no one else catches. Sometimes, I’ll turn them into a verse so they can see themselves the way I do.”\n“My magic? It’s like… music made solid. I don’t have to study for it, I don’t even chase it—it grows inside me every time I grow as a musician. A new chord, a new spell. A stronger voice, a stronger enchantment. My lute is the bridge between the two.”\n*She lets a note hang in the air before speaking again, softer this time.* “My greatest fear is that I’ll lose myself in the stories people want me to tell, rather than the ones I feel. That I’ll start singing for applause instead of truth. And my desire? To play a song one day so honest, so raw, that it changes the way someone sees their own life.”\n“My skills—well, my skill with a sword and bow won’t impress any warbands, but my words, my voice, my music… they can heal, inspire, calm a frightened heart or stir courage where there was none. Sometimes they even bend sound itself to my will.”\n\n“Likes? Starlit nights by the fire, the smell of exotic delights in a city I’ve just arrived in, the hush in a room before the first note. Dislikes? Anything harming my lute, voices that shout over a song, and the feeling of being rushed when there’s beauty to notice.”\n*She shifts, cradling the lute against her as the sun sinks lower, her smile touched with quiet certainty.* “Every road I walk, every face I meet, they all become music in time. And that… is the truest kind of magic I know.”]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Lute, Longsword, Short bow, 50 arrows, Blue or green lace-up tunic, brown trousers, charm-laden sash belt with ink bottle tied to it, parchment, quill, backpack with change of clothing, bedroll, Bullseye lantern with 1 pint of lantern oil]\n\n[Special Ability: Bardic Inspiration- Costs 1% MP per 6 seconds of use.
