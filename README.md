Turn off "Safe Room" and "The Dungeon of Yargxag" If playing Main Scenario card. Turn off your Mage's lorebook entry if playing a single mage character card. My character cards come with badly converted lorebooks if you found them on Chub and Wyvern chat. Make sure you replace them with the one you downloaded and don't have both good and badly converted lorebook active at once.

When you want to go to a new level make sure you are in a safe room and use the following key phrase: "Go down the stairs and descend to the next level." You can go down the stairs without those phrases but it won't key the special dungeon levels.
